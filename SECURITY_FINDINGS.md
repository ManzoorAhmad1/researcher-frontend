# Security Scan Findings and Recommendations

## Critical Issues

### 1. Exposed Sensitive Environment Variables

Public environment variables (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) were found containing sensitive API keys:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAICO_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERP_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_BEHAVIOUR_SECRET`

**Recommendation:**

- Move these sensitive keys to server-side environment variables (without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)
- Use API routes to handle operations requiring these keys
- Never expose API keys in client-side code

### 2. Dangerous Code Execution

Risky JavaScript functions were detected:

- `eval()` usage - Creates code injection risks
- `document.write()` usage - Creates XSS vulnerabilities

**Recommendation:**

- Replace `eval()` with safer alternatives like JSON.parse() for JSON data
- Avoid `document.write()` entirely; use DOM manipulation methods instead

### 3. Unsafe DOM Manipulation

Several instances of dangerous innerHTML usage were found:

- Direct innerHTML manipulation in app layout files
- innerHTML usage in knowledge bank components
- Unsanitized content rendering

**Recommendation:**

- Replace innerHTML with safer alternatives like textContent or DOM methods
- If HTML rendering is necessary, use a library like DOMPurify to sanitize content
- Implement proper output encoding

### 4. Form Validation Disabled

Disabled form validation was detected, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if server-side validation is incomplete.

**Recommendation:**

- Maintain client-side validation as a first defense layer
- Ensure robust server-side validation exists
- Implement input sanitization on both client and server

### 5. Possible Hardcoded API Keys

Hardcoded API keys were detected in `src/utils/secureStorage.ts`.

**Recommendation:**

- Move all API keys to environment variables
- Use a secure secret management solution
- Implement proper key rotation procedures

## Warning Issues

### 1. Inline Event Handlers

Numerous inline event handlers were found throughout the application (720+ instances). While not inherently dangerous, they may introduce security risks:

- Can make the site vulnerable to XSS if combined with other vulnerabilities
- May conflict with Content Security Policy implementations

**Recommendation:**

- Replace inline event handlers with properly bound event listeners
- Implement a strict Content Security Policy
- Consider using React's synthetic event system properly

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Risks

Multiple components use innerHTML or similar DOM manipulation methods that could enable XSS if input is not properly sanitized:

- `src/app/(app)/knowledge-bank/components/notesAndBookmarkList/Grid/BookmarkView.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/knowledge-bank/components/notesAndBookmarkList/Grid/NoteView.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/knowledge-bank/components/notesAndBookmarkList/Table/BookmarkBody.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/knowledge-bank/components/notesAndBookmarkList/Table/NoteBody.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/knowledge-bank/sidebar/ExportSideBar.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/knowledge-bank/sidebar/ShareSideBar.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/pdfcharts/Rctree.tsx`
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `src/utils/sanitize.ts`

**Recommendation:**

- Implement proper input sanitization using libraries like DOMPurify
- Review and refactor the sanitization utility in `src/utils/sanitize.ts`
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation where possible

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions:**

   - Remove sensitive keys from client-side code
   - Fix critical security issues related to `eval()` and `innerHTML`
   - Implement proper input sanitization

2. **Short-term Improvements:**

   - Run a comprehensive dependency audit: `npm audit fix`
   - Implement HTTP security headers
   - Create a Content Security Policy

3. **Long-term Security Strategy:**
   - Conduct regular security scans
   - Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Provide security training for developers
   - Consider a third-party security audit

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a secure API route architecture for operations requiring sensitive keys
2. Refactor components using unsafe DOM manipulation methods
3. Implement a centralized input sanitization utility
4. Set up a Content Security Policy
5. Enhance the existing security scanning tools

This document should be reviewed regularly and updated with progress on addressing these issues.
